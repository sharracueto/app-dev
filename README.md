My favorite food is Sinigang

Recipe:

Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim), I recommend bony cuts such as spare ribs, pork belly with ribs, hocks, knuckles, and tailbone or neck bones for better flavor.
Tomatoes- use ripe, juicy tomatoes
Onion-peeled and quartered
Fish sauce- brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer
Gabi- adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth
Radish (labanos)
Vegetables- the recipe uses sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, and bok choy, but feel free to include other local produce available such as kangkong (water spinach) and pechay
Tamarind- can be fresh pods, paste, or powder mixes
Banana or finger chili peppers (siling haba)-adds a mild heat; optional and can be omitted
